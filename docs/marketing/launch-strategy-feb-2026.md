# Heritage Launch Strategy — February 2026

**Go-Live Date:** Friday, 27 February 2026  
**Positioning:** Second Jumu'ah of Ramadan — peak window for spiritual identity, heritage, and preparation toward Eid in Cape Town.

This document is the playbook for the "Heritage & Healing" launch. Reuse it for future Ramadan launches or for the launch of Al-Kimya Origin.

---

## Why This Date Matters (2026)

- **Avoids the first-week rush** of Ramadan while capturing **sustained engagement** for the rest of the month.
- Gives the Heritage & Craft story time to be shared and discussed **before** the final 10 nights, when focus shifts heavily to worship and Eid preparation.
- Positions Al-Ameen Caps as part of the **Ramadan experience**, not just a store — a central touchpoint for community, identity, and heritage.

## 48-Hour Checklist

### Phase 1: Technical Foundation — **Wednesday, 25 February 2026**

| Task | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Deploy** | Push the final `Heritage.jsx` (Founder's Note, lineage, Schema) to production. Ensure all Heritage-related schema (AboutPage, CreativeWork, Person, mentions) is live. |
| **Inspect** | In Google Search Console, **Request Indexing** for `https://alameencaps.com/heritage`. Goal: Google sees Tuan Guru and Rakiep lineage markers before the press release hits. |
| **Verify** | Confirm "Share to Facebook" (and any share actions) on 5-star reviews work correctly for social proof. |

---

### Phase 2: Media Pitch — **Thursday, 26 February 2026**

| Time | Task |
|------|------|
| **09:00** | Email the press release to the news desks at **VOC (Voice of the Cape)** and **Radio 786**. |
| **Subject line (hook)** | `STORY IDEA: Tuan Guru descendant launches 'Heritage & Healing' initiative for Ramadan.` |
| **Social seeding** | Upload a **teaser** photo to Facebook/Instagram: traditional Fez or Na'lain Cap. **Caption:** *"Something centuries in the making. Tomorrow at 8:00 AM."* |

**Press release reference:** See the full draft in your strategy notes — "The Thread of Tradition" (Tuan Guru descendant, Heritage & Craft, Al-Kimya Origin, Verified Community Voice). Link in release: **alameencaps.com** and **alameencaps.com/heritage**.

---

### Phase 3: Go-Live — **Friday, 27 February 2026**

| Time | Task |
|------|------|
| **08:00** | Post the **Community Voice** Facebook spotlight. Link directly to the new Heritage page (`alameencaps.com/heritage`). |
| **10:00** | GitHub Action runs the **Order Maintenance** script and sends pending review requests — keeps social proof fresh for new visitors. |
| **Post-Jumu'ah** | Check site analytics; expect a traffic spike as visitors browse after congregational prayer. |

## Media Contact List

Use for this launch and future campaigns (update contacts as needed).

| Outlet | Role / Use | Notes |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **VOC (Voice of the Cape)** | News desk / community stories | Local radio; strong Cape Malay and Muslim audience. |
| **Radio 786** | News desk / community stories | Key community broadcaster; pitch as heritage + Ramadan angle. |
| **Cape Argus** | News tips / community desk | Print/digital; use for "Cape Town entrepreneur" and Bo-Kaap heritage angle. |

## Heritage & Healing Hooks (Reusable)

Use these in subject lines, social posts, and one-liners:

- **Authority:** *"Tuan Guru descendant launches 'Heritage & Healing' initiative for Ramadan."*
- **Product + legacy:** *"We don't just make caps; we are weaving a thread of dignity."*
- **Dual mission:** *"Al-Ameen provides the outer garment of tradition; Al-Kimya Origin nurtures the inner heart through spiritual recovery and Sufi wisdom."*
- **Teaser:** *"Something centuries in the making. Tomorrow at 8:00 AM."*
- **CTA:** Link every spotlight to **alameencaps.com/heritage** and **alameencaps.com** (shop).

---

## Reuse for Future Launches

- **Next Ramadan:** Shift dates; keep Phase 1 (deploy + GSC + review share), Phase 2 (media + teaser), Phase 3 (community post + review requests + analytics).
- **Al-Kimya Origin launch:** Replace "Heritage & Craft" with "Al-Kimya Origin" and spiritual recovery messaging; reuse same media list and 48-hour structure; add Al-Kimya URL when live.
