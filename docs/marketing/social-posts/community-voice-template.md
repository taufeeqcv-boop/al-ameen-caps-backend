## Post draft: "Voices of the Community"

**Headline:**  
Voices of the Community: Premium Quality for Every Jumu'ah 🌙

**Body:**

There is no greater honor than hearing how our handcrafted caps become part of your most sacred moments.

Today, we're sharing a special 5-star review from a brother in the community:

"The quality of the Na'lain Cap I received is exceptional. It's breathable, fits perfectly, and was the perfect choice for Jumu'ah. You can truly feel the Bo-Kaap heritage in the craftsmanship. Highly recommended!"

Shukran for the kind words! At Al-Ameen Caps, we are dedicated to preserving our Cape Malay heritage through every Kufi, Taqiyah, and Fez we create. Whether for Salah, Eid, or daily wear, we strive for excellence in every stitch.

Have you received your Al-Ameen Cap yet? We'd love to hear your thoughts! Your feedback helps other brothers find quality headwear they can trust.

## Visual strategy (Gold & Emerald)

When you post, use these three tips to maximize impact:

1. **The visual**  
   Use a high-resolution photo of the product mentioned in the review (e.g. the Na'lain Cap). If possible, photograph it against a backdrop that evokes Bo-Kaap — vibrant colors or traditional textures.

2. **The stars**  
   Use **Emerald Green** or **Muted Gold** star icons as an overlay on the image. This creates "visual scent": the same star styling customers see on the website (Featured Reviews section) appears on Facebook, reinforcing brand consistency.  
   - Gold: brand accent `#D4AF37` (default site stars).  
   - Emerald: deep green `text-emerald-800` / `fill-emerald-800` (homepage variant).

3. **The tag**  
   If the customer who left the review has a public profile, tag them in the comments with "Shukran again!" This often surfaces the post to their friends and expands reach organically.
