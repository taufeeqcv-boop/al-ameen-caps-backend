- **Keywords:** Meta and content target “kufi”, “fez”, “taj”, “Cape Town”, “South Africa”, “Islamic headwear”, suburbs, Ramadaan, Eid, Bo-Kaap, Athlone, etc.
- **Local landing pages:** `/near/bo-kaap`, `/near/athlone` with local titles, descriptions, FAQs, LocalBusiness.
- **Product feed:** ZA-only shipping in Merchant Center; feed URL on alameencaps.com.
- **Conversion tracking:** Purchase on `/success`, transaction_id, new_customer; GA4 + Google Ads (AW-17950617988). Consent Mode + banner.

## 2. SEO (organic dominance)

### Priority keywords (Cape Town & SA)

- **Head terms:** kufi Cape Town, fez Cape Town, Islamic headwear South Africa, buy kufi online South Africa, kufi shop Cape Town.
- **Long-tail:** best kufi shop near Bo-Kaap, kufi for Jumu’ah Cape Town, handcrafted fez South Africa, Nalain cap Cape Town, Islamic cap delivery Cape Town.

### On-site (done or easy)

- [x] LocalBusiness + areaServed (Cape Town, WC, SA, suburbs).
- [x] Geo meta (ZA-WC, Cape Town, coordinates).
- [x] en_ZA locale (og:locale, schema).
- [x] Local landing pages Bo-Kaap, Athlone; clear “Cape Town” and “South Africa” in titles/descriptions and body copy.
- [ ] **Content:** Add more suburb/area mentions where natural (e.g. Shipping, About, Contact). Consider one more local page (e.g. “Cape Town” or “Northern suburbs”) if you serve them.

### Off-site

- **Google Business Profile:** Create/claim listing for “Al-Ameen Caps” with Cape Town address, category (e.g. clothing store, Islamic goods), hours, website, photos. Use same NAP as on site and in schema.
- **Backlinks:** Local directories (Cape Town business, Islamic/community), partnerships, local press or community features.

## 3. Google Ads (paid dominance)

### Geo-targeting

- **Location:** South Africa (country) and/or Western Cape, and/or “Cape Town” and key suburbs (Bo-Kaap, Athlone, Northern/Southern suburbs, etc.) so spend focuses where you deliver.
- **Language:** English (and Afrikaans if you ever add Afrikaans landing content).

### Campaigns

- **Search:** Keywords like “kufi Cape Town”, “buy fez South Africa”, “Islamic cap online”, “kufi shop near me”. Use phrase/exact to control relevance; add “Cape Town” and “South Africa” where relevant.
- **Shopping:** Merchant Center feed is ZA; run Shopping campaigns in South Africa (and Cape Town if you use location-based bidding).
- **Audiences:** Use Customer Match (upload customer list from Admin). Consider “South Africa” and “Cape Town” in-market or affinity if available in your account. Remarketing for site visitors.

### Conversion & bids

- **Conversion action:** Purchase on `/success` (already set up). Use “Maximise conversions” or “Target ROAS” if you have enough volume.
- **Landing pages:** Send traffic to category/product pages (e.g. Shop, Nalain cap) or local pages (Bo-Kaap, Athlone) for “near me” / suburb terms.

## 4. Cape Town–first content

- **Homepage / Hero:** Already says “Cape Town & nationwide delivery”; keep that.
- **About / Heritage:** Already strong on Cape Malay, Bo-Kaap, Athlone; keep and expand with more suburb names where genuine.
- **FAQs:** localFAQs already cover delivery (Cape Town, nationwide); add more FAQs for “where to buy kufi Cape Town”, “do you deliver to [suburb]” if useful.
- **Blog (optional):** “Best kufi for Jumu’ah”, “Islamic headwear in Cape Town”, “Bo-Kaap fez tradition” — can support long-tail and topical authority.
