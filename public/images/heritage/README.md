# Heritage images for the Digital Majlis

Place your heritage images here so they appear on the site.

## Tana Baru Spotlight (first card on The Wall)

- **Filename:** `tana-baru-spotlight.jpg` (or `.png`)
- **Use:** Photo of Tana Baru Cemetery or the grave marker of Tuan Guru (Imam Abdullah Kadi Abdus Salaam). This image is shown on the very first Admin Post card—“Tana Baru — Resting Place of Tuan Guru”—that greets visitors to The Wall.
- **Suggested:** The image you shared of the grave marker with Arabic calligraphy and draped cloths is ideal. Save it as `tana-baru-spotlight.jpg` in this folder.

The site will serve it at:

`https://alameencaps.com/images/heritage/tana-baru-spotlight.jpg`

The database is already set to use this path for the Tana Baru Spotlight card. Once the file is in place, it will appear automatically.

## Optional: other heritage images

You can add more images here (e.g. family trees, manuscripts, Auwal Mosque, portraits) and reference them in copy or in future Majlis submissions by URL, e.g. `/images/heritage/your-file.jpg`.
